Certainly! Below are exploratory test cases for the "Ankidroid" app based on the given screenshots:

### Test Case 1
1.
- **Description:** Creating a new tag using special characters to check for input validation.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is installed and the user can create notes.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Add note" section.
  2. Click on the "Tags" option.
  3. Click the `+` icon to create a new tag.
  4. Enter a tag name containing special characters (e.g., `@#%&*`).
  5. Click "OK".
- **Expected results:** The app should either reject the input and display an error message or accept the tag as valid, without causing any crashes or unexpected behavior.

### Test Case 2
2.
- **Description:** Searching for a tag that has not been created.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is installed and at least one note with a tag has been created.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Add note" section.
  2. Click on the "Tags" option.
  3. Click the search icon.
  4. Enter a tag name that does not exist in the system.
- **Expected results:** The app should display a message indicating no results found and should not crash or show unwanted behavior.

### Test Case 3
3.
- **Description:** Attempt to create a tag that is a duplicate of an existing tag.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is installed and at least one tag has already been created.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Add note" section.
  2. Click on the "Tags" option.
  3. Click the `+` icon to create a new tag.
  4. Enter a tag name that is identical to an existing tag.
  5. Click "OK".
- **Expected results:** The app should notify the user that the tag already exists and should not create a duplicate tag.

### Test Case 4
4.
- **Description:** Cancel the creation of a new tag.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is installed.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Add note" section.
  2. Click on the "Tags" option.
  3. Click the `+` icon to create a new tag.
  4. Enter any text in the tag input field.
  5. Click "CANCEL".
- **Expected results:** The tag creation process should be aborted, no new tag should be created, and the user should return to the previous screen or view without any changes.

### Test Case 5
5.
- **Description:** Attempt to perform multiple tag additions rapidly to check for race conditions.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is installed.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Add note" section.
  2. Click on the "Tags" option.
  3. Rapidly click (i.e., more than 5 times) the `+` icon to create multiple tags in a row without entering any tag name.
- **Expected results:** The app should handle the rapid clicks gracefully by either queuing up the creation process or throttling the input accordingly without crashing or showing erratic behavior.

These test cases should help uncover potential issues with tag creation and management in "Ankidroid".
