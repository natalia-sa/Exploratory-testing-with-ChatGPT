- **Prerequisites:** Ensure the "ActivityDiary" app is installed and Location Service is enabled.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the "ActivityDiary" app.
  2. Navigate to the Settings screen.
  3. Set the Update period to a very low value (e.g., 1 minute) and the Update distance to a very low value (e.g., 1 meter).
  4. Move around with the device.
- **Expected Results:** The app should handle frequent updates without affecting performance, ensuring that updates occur every minute or upon moving 1 meter.

### Test Case 8:
- **Description:** Test the scenario where the app's data storage is full.
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure the "ActivityDiary" app is installed and the device’s storage is almost full.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the "ActivityDiary" app.
