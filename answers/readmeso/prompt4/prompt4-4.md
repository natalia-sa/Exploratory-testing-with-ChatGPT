# Secondary prompt 4

"
From the point of view of a tester, give me exploratory test cases to the Section Selection feature in the readme generator app, suggesting unusual flows, trying to find possible bugs, failures, security issues, etc. I will provide screenshots of the app GUI. The test cases should follow the structure below:

[test number]
-Description: The test case description
-Prerequisites: specifies the conditions that must be met before executing the test steps
-Steps: Enumerated steps to execute the test
-Expected results: The expected test results

### Answer

### Test Case 1: SENSELESS
- **Description:** Attempt to add the same section multiple times.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Click on the "Title and Description" section.
  2. Click on the "Title and Description" section again.
  3. Repeat this process for any other section (e.g., "Acknowledgements").
- **Expected Results:** The application should prevent adding the same section multiple times or handle it gracefully without crashing.

### Test Case 2 
- **Description:** Add and delete a section rapidly to check for any race conditions.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Click on the "Appendix" section to add it.
  2. Click on the trash icon for the "Appendix" section to delete it.
  3. Rapidly repeat steps 1 and 2 several times.
- **Expected Results:** The application should perform the add and delete operations without crashing or showing inconsistent behavior.

### Test Case 3:
- **Description:** Check the behavior of search functionality with special characters.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Enter characters like `!@#$%^&*()` in the section search bar.
  2. Observe how the application responds.
- **Expected Results:** The application should handle the input without crashing. It should either show no results or handle special characters gracefully.

### Test Case 4:
- **Description:** Add a custom section with unusual characters in the name.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Click on the "+ Custom Section" button.
  2. Enter a name for the custom section using special characters or emoji (e.g., "Custom Section ðŸ’¡").
  3. Add the custom section to the README.
- **Expected Results:** The custom section should be added, and the application should handle special characters or emoji in the section name without any issues.

### Test Case 5:
- **Description:** Test the section order change functionality.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should have multiple sections added.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add multiple sections (e.g., "Title and Description," "Acknowledgements," "Authors").
  2. Drag and drop to reorder the sections.
  3. Observe if the order is updated accordingly.
- **Expected Results:** The sections should be reordered as per the drag and drop action and reflect the new order correctly.

### Test Case 6:
- **Description:** Add a large number of sections to check for performance issues.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add all available sections one by one.
  2. Observe the performance of the application.
- **Expected Results:** The application should handle the addition of all sections without significant performance degradation or crashing.

### Test Case 7 BUG (Some languages do not have translatio)
- **Description:** Test the language change functionality.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Change the application language to a different language from the dropdown.
  2. Attempt to select and add various sections.
  3. Observe if the sections are added correctly and the interface updates to the selected language.
- **Expected Results:** The sections should be added correctly, and the application interface should change to the selected language without issues.

### Test Case 8 
- **Description:** Simulate a network failure while adding a section.
- **Prerequisites:** The application should be open, and the user should be on the section selection screen.
- **Steps:**
  1. Turn off the internet connection.
  2. Attempt to add a section (e.g., "API Reference").
  3. Observe the application behavior.
- **Expected Results:** The application should handle the network failure gracefully, potentially showing an error message or preventing the addition until the connection is restored.

Testing with these exploratory cases should help identify potential bugs and ensure robust functionality for the Section Selection feature in the README generator app.
