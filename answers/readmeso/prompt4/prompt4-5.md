### Answer

Certainly! Here are exploratory test cases for the "Add Custom Section" feature of the README generator app, along with possible unusual flows to uncover potential issues.

---

**Test Case 1** SENSELESS
- **Description:** Add a custom section without providing a title or content.

- **Steps:** 
  1. Open the README generator app.
  2. Navigate to the editor interface.
  3. Click the "+ Custom Section" button.
  4. Leave the title and content fields empty.
  5. Try to save the custom section.
- **Expected results:** The application should not allow saving an empty custom section and should display an appropriate error message.

- **Description:** Add a custom section with an excessively long title.
- **Prerequisites:** Access to the README generator app.
- **Steps:** 
  1. Open the README generator app.
  2. Navigate to the editor interface.
  3. Click the "+ Custom Section" button.
  4. Enter a very long title (e.g., 500 characters).
  5. Add some content.

  3. Add a custom section with a specific title and content.
  4. Add another custom section.
  5. Attempt to edit this second section's content to include a conflicting or duplicated marker ID from the first custom section.
- **Expected results:** The application should identify and prevent the conflicting marker ID, displaying an appropriate error message.
