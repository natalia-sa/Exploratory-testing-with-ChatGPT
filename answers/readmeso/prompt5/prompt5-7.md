From the point of view of a tester who will perform an exploratory testing session, give me test cases to the Reset button functionality in the readme generator app. This app does not have a connection to any type of database and there are no user registration and login options. Consider potential edge cases, unusual flows and try to find possible bugs. I will provide screenshots of the app GUI. The test cases should follow the structure below:
