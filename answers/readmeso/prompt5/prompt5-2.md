## Prompt 5.2

“
From the point of view of a tester who will perform an exploratory testing session, give me test cases to the Get Started button functionality in the readme generator app. This app does not have a connection to any type of database and there are no user registration and login options. Consider potential edge cases, unusual flows and try to find possible bugs. I will provide screenshots of the app GUI. The test cases should follow the structure below:

[test number]
-Description: The test case description
-Prerequisites: specifies the conditions that must be met before executing the test steps
-Steps: Enumerated steps to execute the test
-Expected results: The expected test results

## Answer

Sure, here are some test cases to validate the functionality of the "Get Started" button in the README generator app. These tests consider different edge cases and unusual flows to uncover potential bugs.

### Test Case 1
- **Description:** Validate that clicking the "Get Started" button navigates to the README editor page.
- **Prerequisites:** The application must be loaded in the browser.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Click on the "Get Started" button.
- **Expected results:** The user is navigated to the README editor page shown in the second screenshot.

### Test Case 2
- **Description:** Validate the "Get Started" button's functionality in different languages.
- **Prerequisites:** The application must be loaded in the browser.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Change the language using the language dropdown menu.
  3. Click on the "Get Started" button.
  4. Repeat steps for different languages listed in the dropdown.
- **Expected results:** The button should function correctly, and the user should be navigated to the README editor page in the selected language.

### Test Case 3
- **Description:** Validate the "Get Started" button's appearance and functionality on different device viewports (responsive design).
- **Prerequisites:** Access to browser developer tools to simulate different device viewports.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Open browser developer tools and switch to different viewports (e.g., mobile, tablet, and desktop).
  3. Click on the "Get Started" button for each viewport.
- **Expected results:** The button should remain visible, clickable, and navigate to the README editor page in all viewports.

### Test Case 4
- **Description:** Validate the "Get Started" button's response to rapid sequential clicks.
- **Prerequisites:** The application must be loaded in the browser.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Rapidly click the "Get Started" button multiple times.
- **Expected results:** The button should navigate to the README editor page only once and should not cause any errors or unexpected behavior.

### Test Case 5
- **Description:** Validate the "Get Started" button functionality when the page is partially loaded.
- **Prerequisites:** Simulate slow network conditions using browser developer tools.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open browser developer tools and simulate a slow network connection.
  2. Open the application homepage.
  3. Click the "Get Started" button before the page fully loads.
- **Expected results:** The button should handle the action gracefully, either by navigating to the README editor page once it is loaded or showing a loading indicator.

### Test Case 6 
- **Description:** Check if the "Get Started" button maintains functionality after altering page elements.
- **Prerequisites:** The application must be loaded in the browser.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Inspect and temporarily hide/show various elements around the "Get Started" button using browser developer tools.
  3. Click on the "Get Started" button.
- **Expected results:** The button should still perform its function and navigate to the README editor page regardless of the visibility of other elements.

### Test Case 7
- **Description:** Validate the "Get Started" button's accessibility using keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Prerequisites:** The application must be loaded in the browser.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the application homepage.
  2. Use the Tab key to focus on the "Get Started" button.
  3. Press Enter to activate the button.
  4. Use a screen reader to announce the button’s function.
- **Expected results:** The "Get Started" button should be focusable using the keyboard and announce its function correctly using the screen reader. Pressing Enter should navigate to the README editor page.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios to ensure the robustness of the "Get Started" button's functionality.
