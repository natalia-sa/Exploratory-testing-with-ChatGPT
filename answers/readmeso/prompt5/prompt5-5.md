## Prompt 5.5

“
From the point of view of a tester who will perform an exploratory testing session, give me test cases to the Section search functionality in the readme generator app. This app does not have a connection to any type of database and there are no user registration and login options. Consider potential edge cases, unusual flows and try to find possible bugs. I will provide screenshots of the app GUI. The test cases should follow the structure below:

[test number]
-Description: The test case description
-Prerequisites: specifies the conditions that must be met before executing the test steps
-Steps: Enumerated steps to execute the test
-Expected results: The expected test results

### Test Case 7
- **Description:** Test section search is case-insensitive.
- **Prerequisites:** The app is opened, and the user is on the editor page.
- **Steps:**
  1. Click on the "Search for a section" input field.
  2. Type "acknowledgements" in lower case in the search field.
  3. Observe the search results.
